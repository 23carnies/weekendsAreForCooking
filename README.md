# Weekends Are For Cooking

I love to cook and bake. During the Covid-19 shutdown, I found that I missed a calendar full of events. To help pass the time, I decided to go through my mother's old cookbooks and make recipes from them. I listed dinners and desserts on the calendar to have things to look forward to on the weekends. 

We tried to keep a schedule during the week and thus weekends became the time to make more elaborate recipes. This is a blog I kept of the recipes I made.
