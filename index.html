      <img src="#" alt="Picture of Karen">
      <p>Hello! My name is Karen. I have loved cooking and baking all my life. For the last 15 years I have run my family's buisness six days a week.
      With a busy social life and a rowing obsession as well, I haven't had much time for cooking lately. But with the whole world shut down due to
      the virus, I am rekindling an old passion.</p>

          <h2>New World, New Me</h2>
          <h6>April 4, 2020</h6>
          <p>Mama started teaching me to bake when I was 2 years old. With the family business very new, there was little money for end of year gifts
          to clients. Mama would start baking and freezing in September. I learned along the way. As a teenager, I started working in restaurant kitchens.
          I worked 10 years in the industry, cooking and waiting tables. After college, I made my way back to the family business. For the last 15 years, I
          worked six days a week. Which isn't bad. My folks worked seven days a week for decades. <br>Never having been one to give up my social life, the
          thing I ended up giving up was cooking. Between work, a rowing obsession, a stricter diet, and lots of workouts, something had to give. There are
          only so many hours in the day, unfortunately.</p>
          <p>But now there is the Covid19 Pandemic. The world has come to an abrupt halt. My world has come to an abrupt halt. My social life is now on
          FaceTime. The river, my rowing friends, and my boat are miles away. My CrossFit workouts are now on Zoom. And my job has all but ended. <br>So
          we can sit around and be sad, or try to make the best of things. Husband and I have a huge list of items to do around the house. And I am returning
          to my love of cooking and baking. I may have to work out some more to keep up with the calories, but there's time for that too!</p>
          <h3>Weekends Are For Cooking</h3>
          <p>I realized a couple weeks ago that everything on our paper kitchen calendar was just crossed out plans of a former life. So I have decided to
          put new things on the calendar. There's a family Zoom Happy Hour at 5p on Fridays. Check! Indian Food Extravaganza on Saturday. Check!<br>I am trying
          to find a routine in this new reality. It's not easy. So I'm devoting most of the weekends to cooking the more complicated dishes that may take more time.
          And I'm filling my calendar with delicious plans!</p>

              <p>I have always loved cookbooks. The descriptions, pictures, and instructions that become such a delicious thing for me to consume. A great cookbook
              will allow you to taste the food in your mind. And an awesome cookbook gives detailed instructions, follows standard recipe writing format, and calls
              for basic ingredients. (There is nothing worse than a cookbook that calls for a storebought box ingredient instead of its base parts.) <br>But the very
              best cookbooks explain so much more about what to do in the kitchen.</p>

              <p>I remember this book from when I was a kid. This wasn't the book I was allowed to touch. There was a more modern version that had most of the same
              recipies. But this one. This is the gold standard. Mama didn't let me <em>borrow</em> this book until I was in my thirites. And even then it was under
               threat of mama retaliation. But finally, a few years ago, she gave me this one and my Grandmother's 1963 Good Housekeeping Cookbook. These are two of
              my most prized possessions.</p>

              <h4>Nostalgia</h4>
              <p>Food is comforting. Our mothers and grandmothers (and fathers as well to be sure) nurtured us with food as we grew up. We associate certain foods
              with holidays, birthdays, sicknees, celebrations, and many more factions of our lives. So in this weird time in our world when everything seems uncertain,
              I want to comfort myself, my husband, and my neighbors with the foods from my childhood.</p>

              <p>The first thing I decided to make from the book was Mexican Wedding Cakes. The book gives this as their alternative name. The original name is
              Russian Teacakes. I like both names. They are a simple shortbread that is rolled in powdered sugar while still warm. I cut the recipe in half for
              this making. I'm trying not to gain too much weight while walking down this memory lane.</p>
              <p>All of these recipes are on the Betty Crocker website. I'm checking them to see that they are the same as the book. Find these delicious and

          <h2>Stir Crazy</h2>
          <h6>April 8, 2020</h6>

              <img src="resources/photos/torteWithWhip2.jpg" class="leftPic" alt="Photo of my Lemon Schaum Torte" width="300">
              <p>This is my first full week at home. Last week I still had to work a couple days. And I went out for beer and vodka last Thursday before the full
                State of Georgia shutdown went into effect on Friday. My sleep schedule has rotated about 4 hours. For several years now I've been getting up at 5am
                to get to the river or CrossFit for early workouts. I'm working out just as much, if not more, now but since it's all at the house, there is no need
                to get up so damn early. And I need to work out this much to offset all of these tasty treats!
                After the wedding cookies, I dove right into the Betty Crocker cookbook. I bought a 30 pack of eggs to prepare for the quarantine. And then we got
                new chickens.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="resources/photos/chickens.jpg" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="My five beautiful hens">
              <p>We have 5 beautiful girls who are laying everyday. We are awash in eggs suddenly. So I went big. Betty's <em>Lemon Schaum Torte</em>. Meringue shell,
                lemon pudding filling, fresh whipped cream. What's not to love here. I happened to have all of the things needed. And though in reality it only used
                three eggs, it felt like a lot. I cannot recommend this one enough. It was not difficult to make though it did take a lot of time. (There was time in
                an off oven and an overnight chill that I did not anticipate.) Check out the recipe <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/lemon-schaum-torte/d597710f-7441-4a12-bd27-352eaf768151">here.</a></p>

              <h3>What a Hootnanny!</h3>
              <p>I've also been spending some time in one of my favorite subreddits <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/">Old Recipes.</a>I found this great post
              for Nana's Hootenanny. <img src="resources/photos/nanasHootenannyCard.JPG" class="leftPic" alt="Recipe card for Nana's Hootenanny" width="300">I can no longer find the post. I'm so happy
              I saved this picture. u/harrypottertoots, if you're out there, thank you so much for this recipe. Please let me link to the post. There was a fun discussion
               in the comments about what exactly is a "square of butter." The concensus was two tablespoons. Which carved out of a stick is about a cube. This is a souffl&eacute;.
              Apparently it has a lot of names. Dutch baby. German pancake. Bismarck. And my absolute favorite Pfannkuchen. <br> But it's a souffl&eacute;. This is
              something I have avoided most of my cooking life believing it would be terribly difficut. <em>It is not.</em> I actually can't believe how easty it was.
              Just like the card says. Mix everything together. Put the square of butter in a pan in the oven. When it melts, pour the batter in. Watch delightfully from
              outside the oven window as it rises to the point of almost touching the top of the oven! <img src="resources/photos/hootenannyOven.jpg" class="rightPic" alt="Hootenanny in the Oven" width="300"> As the commenters pointed
              out, this can be sweet or savory since the batter is neutral. I filled ours with mushrooms and onions saute&eacute;d with cured ham and topped that with <a href="https://www.savoryexperiments.com/baked-kale-gratin/">
              this kale gratin recipe.</a>I just used cheddar but, man, it was delicious!</p>

            <div>
              <h3>Naan Better</h3>
              <p>While I was busily prepping our hootenanny, someone lamented on our family WhatsApp that their favorite Indian restaurant had closed. I had takeout from that
              place last time I visited there. It was amazing. Sad they are not making it through this chaos. But this gave me the idea of putting things on the calendar.

          <h2>What Day Is It?</h2>
          <h6>April 9, 2020</h6>
          <div class="flex">
            <p>The days are blending together. Get up. Workout. Paint something. Workout. Cook something. Drink heavily. (Oh, I should apply this resurgence of cooking love
              to my drinking as well.) I just heard a friend talking about a <em><a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-a-shrub-759919">shrub</a></em> and I think
              I will try that out tonight.<br>The only things on my calendar are video happy hours with friends and family. This is how I know what day it is. Tonight I
              get to see my rowing group. I miss these ladies so much. We have spent years of early mornings on the river together. It is a peaceful way to begin the
              workday and I miss it dearly. Excited to actually get to see them all together tonight.</p>
              <div>
            <h3>Taco Tuesday</h3>
            <p>The week leading up to Indian Food Party had other ethnic dinners. I love Mexican food. I go into withdrawls if I don't get a taco every few days.
            So I decided to try making my own flour tortillas. To be honest, I much prefer corn tortillas but they are much more complicated. Flour tortillas were pretty
             straightforward. And they were good practice for Saturday's naan.</p>
            <img src="resources/photos/tortilla.jpg" class="leftPic" width="300" alt="My first tortilla">
            <p>I used <a href="https://www.mexicanplease.com/flour-tortillas-made-bacon-fat/">this recipe</a> from mexicanplease.com that uses bacon fat instead of oil. Because
             pandemic, people. Gotta be frugal these days. There's a jar of bacon fat in my fridge at all times. I just found the best use for it! These tortillas were fantastic!
            And while they smelled like bacon (bonus!) there wasn't a bacon-y-ness added to the taste. My tacos still tasted like tacos. We used this heat-and-eat storebought
            carnitas I love from Kroger. 10 minutes to tacos. Perfect for busy weeknights. Or when you're feeling lazy during quarantine. I made a quick cabbage slaw with vinegar
            and my homemade hot honey for a little kick. Husband loved it.</p>

            <div>
            <h3>Naan More Waiting</h3>
            <p>Friday night I made a cooking plan for Saturday. There are so many parts of Indian cooking that I am not familiar with I figured I needed a game plan. Step one:
              My restaurant needed a name. Naan Better. You can find your own Indian restaurant name <a href="https://best4businesses.com/creative-indian-restaurant-names/">here.</a>
              After that an order of operations. Thaw chicken. (I am known to forget to thaw things.) Make the Indian spice mix Garam Masala. This was an easy mix. I have a serious spice obsession, so I
              didn't have to scramble for anything. <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/142967/easy-garam-masala/">Recipe here.</a><br>
              Next, make the <a href="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/samosa-recipe/">samosa filing.</a>This recipe is great. It's a bit of work but worth it. Good, easy-to-follow
              instructions for the filling and the dough. <img src="resources/photos/samosas.jpg" class="leftPic" width="300" alt="Full plate of samosas">Made the dough next. I also added a <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/raita-indian-yogurt-cucumber-condiment">raita</a>
               sauce to go with the samosas. I couldn't get any cilantro to make the green sauce you get in takeout. But this creamy cucumber sauce was awesome.
              <p>While samosa dough was resting, made the naan dough. <a href="https://canadiancookingadventures.com/recipe/garlic-naan-bread-recipe/">
              This</a> is the recipe I used. Funny that the one I picked was from Canada, but it worked. well. I did let the yeast bloom a little too long and lost some fluffiness
              on the frying. But live and learn.</p>
              <p>After the naan and samosas were done, I finally made the <a href="https://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/gordon-ramsay-s-butter-chicken">Butter Chicken</a> using this Gordon
              Ramsey recipe. This was much easier than I thought it would be. And so delicious. Husband was super happy with dinner. Said it tasted like takeout. Karen for the win!</p>
            <img src="resources/photos/naanBetterPlate.jpg" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="My full plate of naan, samosas and butter chicken">
            <p>My Naan Better experiment kept me busy for about three hours. After an entire day of painting our porch, I was a nice change. I'm still not done painting the porch. Ugh.
            Husband asked for dessert last night. I was sad to respond that we had nothing left. Groceries are being delivered today though. And he asked for another lemon torte.
            I started that this morning. My second try looks much better. Pictures tomorrow. Have a great evening!</p>

          <h2>TGIF, Good Friday!</h2>
          <h6>April 10th, 2020</h6>
          <div class="flex">
            <p>I'm not a religeous person, but I love a holiday. Grandma said you had to wait until Good Friday to plant in the garden or take the potted plants outside. Here in the South,
            Easter is notice that it is really Spring. This is a fairly late Easter so Spring has sprung for the most part. It is a little chilly today. But I've been running in shorts and
            tanks for over a week. No complaints.<br>
            Friday is Friday. Even in quarantine. I stayed in bed a little longer this morning. Gave myself the day off from the house list. And got busy before my noon workout.
            Discovered Betty's Refigerator Cookies. <img src="resources/photos/fridgeCookies.jpg" class="leftPic" width="300" alt="Refridgerator Cookies Sliced on Board"> Butterscotch and Vanilla.
            Although there are several variations for these cookies. These will be great for the nights when Husband asks, "Do we have any cookies?" This way we don't have to have cookies.
            They are easily made. And fresh cookies are the best anyway. The dough can also be frozen.<br>I cut the recipe in half and made the two different flavors. Threw them in the fridge until just a minute ago.
            Now I have cookies! Betty's website seems to have altered the original recipe somewhat. <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/brown-sugar-refrigerator-cookies/96eed629-c5ae-4752-992b-c7e8010cd5e7">This recipe</a> is a bit
            of a mix of two of the variatios in the book. The vanilla version used only granulated sugar while the brown sugar version was called butterscotch. Both of these flavors omitted the
            cinnamon. Cinnamon had it's own variation. But play around with it. I'm sure they will all turn out wonderfully!</p>
          </div>
          <img src="resources/photos/fridgeCookiesPlated.jpg" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="Cookies plated on top of cookbook">
          <div class="flex">
            <p>While the cookies were in the fridge, I did my noon workout on zoom. Really nice to see my coach. I go to a small gym. I miss everyone. I miss seeing people...<br>
            Anyway. I also did a little bit of work and made a batch of Almond Liqueur and started a batch of Coffee Liqueur. These are two of my go to Christmas gifts. And two of my favorite
            liqueurs. I made a special trip to the liquor store before the state shut down to make sure I had Smirnoff 100 proof to make these. Once you make your own, you'll never buy the
            name brand stuff again. These are so simple to mix up and you can adjust them to your own taste. The <a href="https://bellalimento.com/2012/12/29/how-to-make-amaretto/">almond liqueur</a>
             is ready to drink as soon as it's made. The <a href="https://lovelygreens.com/how-to-make-kahlua-homemade-coffee-liqueur/">coffee flavor</a> takes about
            a month (but you can start stealing a drink or two after a couple weeks!) You can also substitute brewed coffee for the hot water if you don't have instant coffee. This can also be made decaf.</p>
          </div>
          <img src="resources/photos/circleTorteNoWhip.jpg" class="leftPic" width="300" alt="Meringue shell filled with Lemon pudding">

          <div class="flex">
            <p>And yesterday's lemon tarte? Specatacular! It's prettier than the first. Still tastes wonderful. A couple more tries and I won't need the recipe. I do think I lost a little on the
              consistency of the meringue in scaling back the sugar. It wasn't enough of a difference in calories to be worth it. Next time I will put the whole amount of sugar in and just do a
              few more situps! Family zoom happy hour starts in 5 minutes. Cheers! Have a great evening. Wash your hands and stay inside!</p>

            <p>It's been a quiet, rainy Sunday here in Atlanta. There's lots of family pictures from quarantined Easter celebrations all over. Glad to see some of the cousins still breaking out
            the fancy china and silver for the occasion. Things are a little more low key here. Haven't made any decisions about dinner yet. But! In honor of our friend Mr. Easter Bunny, I made

            to try them. And with Sunday's extra time, I actually broke out my Betty Crocker gel colors that have been hiding in the pantry.<br>I love cake donuts. I've never made them and thought they
            would have been much more difficult than they were. I used my 3" biscuit cutter and a bottle lid for cutting. They were fast to fry. And even the icing, while a little time consuming, was not
            difficult. Find the rainbow icing <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/rainbow-doughnut-icing/e5f74017-2f01-4b6d-8f4e-0da287395f98">here.</a></p>

            to shell. Happily though, deviled eggs leave any divots on the plate side hidden from sight.<br>A few tips from Mom: Flip the eggs over every 12 hours for a day or so before boiling. This will center the
            yolks. Put baking soda in the water while boiling. This can help loosen the shells. You can also slide a spoon beneath the shell to loosen it. And last, even if some of the whites aren't perfect,
            put them on the plate. It's better to show that you made the effort, even if the finished product isn't perfect. Hope the Bunny was good to you. Have a great evening.</p>

          <h2>Happy Tuesday, Y'all!</h2>
          <h6>April 14, 2020</h6>
          <div class="flex">
            <p>Look at me knowing what day it is! I did have to check my watch for the date. Which reminds me. I had planned for several months to do a <i>Last Night on the Titanic</i>
              dinner party tonight. I know there are menus from the voyage from first, second, and third class meals. Period costumes. Vintage foods. Does it seem weird to have a dinner party
              to commemorate the anniversary of a tragedy? Well let's just hope anyone who has been stuck on a cruise ship this spring is back home safe and healthy by now.</p>
            <p>So today I had to take a break from the sweets. We still have lemon torte, cookies, and donuts here. And yesterday I made vegetable broth. We keep a couple of gallon ziplock bags in the
            freezer. <img src="resources/photos/AveryIslandDeviledShrimpRecipe.jpg" class="leftPic" width="350" alt="Page 310 of Betty Crocker's Cookbook Avery Island Deviled Shrimp Recipe">
            Anytime we cut and onion, peel a carrot, or any other vegetable we keep the scraps in the freezer. When they finally get full we make broth. Meat bones are also great
            for this! Broth is broth here. I don't need it to be specifically veggie or chicken (unless vegetarians are coming for dinner.) But mostly we mix everything together. This is so
            much better than store bought. I don't add salt or spices. There's plenty of flavor there. The extras can be added when you use the broth. <br>
            So I spent some time last night with Betty Crocker trying to find a recipe with broth. I freeze plenty of it but wanted to use some right away.<br><br>
            I'm making two things today. Golden Crescents and Avery Island Deviled Shrimp, well Salmon. I haven't been able to get any shrimp lately. But we can make substitutions in
            quarantine. Or anytime. It's fine. Try things out! If it doesn't work, order a pizza! No problem.
            <br>
            I'm not 100% about this one, but I'm trusting Betty. The recipe is for shrimp rolled in egg and breadcrumbs and saute&eacuted in butter. Which sounds just fine. And a Deviled
            Shrimp Sauce poured over the shrimp and a bed of rice. The sauce is onion, garlic, butter, <em>chicken broth</em>, with steak sauce, Tabasco, mustard, and lemon juice. This recipe
            is not on the web in its original format. Betty doesn't seem to have it on her website at all. So here's the page from the book.<br>
            <p>I'll let you know how the salmon turns out tomorrow. <img src="resources/photos/GoldenCrescents.jpg" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="Golden Crescent Rolls">I already made the crescents though! They turned out pretty good. They are not the crescent rolls you get out of the
            can. But that was not a laminated dough. (The flakey kind with butter layered between the flour.)
            I'll be honest and tell you that I made several mistakes in this one. And look! They still look good! My yeast took a <em>long<em> time to work. I used Self-Rising flour for
            the first time ever. I don't think I used enough flour. Had some issues rolling it out too. But hey, they will be great with dinner. And I learned things.<br><br> Well that's it
            for today. I'll see y'all tomorrow with salmon pictures. And maybe more bread. Stay safe!</p>

          <h6>April 16, 2020</h6>
          <div class="flex">
            <p>Ok. Real talk, folks. You know how, on occasion, you get really drunk and forget to make dinner? Or eat at all? It's ok. There's no judgment here. This is a safe space.
              Well, that's what happened to me after I signed off last time. I forgot that some of those beers are 12%. Oops. They sneak up on you. Anyway, I didn't make that salmon until
              last night. And it was delicious. The Avery Island Deviled Sauce is really, really good. It is not, however, really pretty. I will make it again and we will find a way to
              make it look prettier. But I did not take a picture of it. It was not worthy. So tasty. So bland looking though. It looked so bland I couldn't believe how good it tasted.
              Maybe that's its secret. Hmm.</p>

            <p>Today I had to venture into the world. So I have no delicious treats for you. I do have this picture of me in my mask and shaggy hair in need of cutting.
            I did clean out a bathroom cabinet and also painted the Furniture Monster (our parlor Frankenstein creation; pictures tomorrow). Marking things off the ever-growing list.
            I also got to distantly visit my coach at the gym. She loaned me a barbell and weights. I am exstatic. Tomorrow I can deadlift. And make tasty treats. Life is about
            balance, people. So tomorrow I promise something pretty and delicious. Well, I promise pictures of whatever it is, however it turns out. We'll hope for the best.
            Right now I am off for a video happy hour with my rowing women. Video chats are making this whole situation bearable. I promise not to forget to eat dinner though.</p>
            <p>Until tomorrow, have a fantastic evening! Stay safe. Wash your hands! Make something you've never tried before.</p>

          <h2>Friday is the Weekend</h2>
          <h6>April 17, 2020</h6>
          <div>
            <div class="flex">
            <p>Well hello there! Happy Friday! Just finished our Friday Family Happy Hour. It's really good to see everyone each week. I think this has been good for all of us. And we
            seem to be getting better at zoom. With twelve connections and about twenty people each week, that's not alawys easy. But a system of elementary school hand raising has
          been implemented thanks to MH. And it's definitely helping.</p>
          <div  class="float">
            <img src="resources/photos/furnitureMonster.jpg" class="leftPic rotate space" width="275" alt="The Furniture Monster- a bunch of different pieces of furniture built together into one piece and painted white">
            <p>So how's your day been? I have been very productive. I finished painting the Furniture Monster! And am all but finished going through everything that was in it. There's still a
              few random pits strewn about the parlor. But it's almost there. And the Furniture Monster itself looks great! Much less cluttered.
              Here's a picture of it empty. It's a bunch of random pieces of furniture we built into one piece several years ago. It looked insane and then we painted it. Looks good, eh?<br><br>
              I got to lift an actual barbell today. It was fantastic. I did not lift much. I am out of practice. But a big thanks to Q4 Crossfit in Hapeville, Ga. So happy to have weights
              again. I did my workout and my reward? Is cake!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I made Betty's New Starlight Cake with <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/vanilla-buttercream-frosting/39107a19-be94-4571-9031-f1fc5bd1d606">Vanilla Butter Frosting.</a>
            Betty's website does not have this cake listed. I found it <a href="https://www.recipelink.com/msgbrd/board_2/2000/SEP/8188.html">here instead.</a> I used half butter and half shortening. It
            is not overly yellow. But it is delish! I don't think I have ever made a cake from scratch. I usually get a box when I'm craving cake. This was very simple though.<br><br> The instructions
            say to beat the batter on low for one minute and high for three minutes. I can say for certain I have never mixed a cake batter that much. The batter was fluffy and much bigger in the bowl.
            This must have led to the fluffy texture. It is fantastic. I rember making lots of frosting as a kid. I remember it being a pain. I can tell you that most of the time I use the mixer I got
            from Grandma. <img src="resources/photos/grandmasMixer.jpg" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="Picture of Grandma's hand mixer from the sixty's or seventy's">
            But it was in the dishwasher after the cake batter and I used the Kitchenaid for the frosting. This was the smartest thing I did all day. That mixer is made for frosting. My butter was not
            soft. I put the paddle attachment on and walked away. Came back. Put in the sugar and walked away again. I'm certain this is why this mixer was invented. Good stuff. And a
            good thing. Because I LOVE frosting. It is my weakness. I had to make a second batch to frost the cake. And now I have some frosting in the fridge. I'm the winner.<br><br>
            I baked this in the only cake pan I have. It's square and my cake plate is round. But this is what we are working with. I also haven't frosted a cake since I was 14. I don't have all the
            proper tools. But I do have a piping bag. The first line was rough but they got better. I'm feeling proud of myself.</p>
            <p>So there you go, folks! One delicious cake frosted and everything! Hope you are safe at home and enjoying a tasty treat or beverage. We haven't decided what to make this weekend. It will
            be a surprise. Until then, take good care of yourself and your family. And try something new!</p>

          <h2>Turkish Inspired Delights</h2>
          <h6>April 21, 2020</h6>
          <div>
            <p>Good Tuesday morning to you! You may have noticed that I kind of took the weekend off. I finished painting the porch finally. Things are getting marked off the housework list! Husband made
              fresh tortillas and tacos for us Sunday. I am not the only one with some talent in the kitchen. With the weekdays and weekend days blending together, I figured it was okay to rest on Sunday.
              Yesterday I made a big grocery run. Hoping we have enough now that I don't have to go back out for a while. </p>

                </div>
              </div>
            <p>I am excited to tell you about the fabulous dinner we had last night. Sunday night I was looking for a new idea for the eggplant sitting in the fridge. I found <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/charred-eggplant-burrata-and-pomegranate-walnut-relish">this
              Turkish inspired recipe</a> on Food and Wine. I had to make a few adjustments for the specialty ingredients. The recipe called for grilled Japanese eggplant. I used the normal Italian eggplant
              available at any grocery. I <em>love<em> grilled eggplant. It is one of my favorite things. We have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Pro-Grid-Griddle-Reversible-Easy-Grip/dp/B00008GKDQ/ref=sr_1_3_mod_primary_new?dchild=1&keywords=indoor+grill+pan+emeril&qid=1587481786&sr=8-3">
              one of these</a> indoor grill pans. It gets used all the time. It's fantastic for vegetables or my Sunday food prepping of grilled chicken. And last night's dinner was made entirely on it. <br><br>
              The eggplant recipe called for Burrata-that super amazing fresh mozzarella filled with cream. I had some in Italy. It is ridiculously good. But I don't have any here. And that was not on my
              quarantine grocery list. I could have just used ricotta but wanted a little more kick to it. So I mixed in some whole milk feta in with my ricotta. It was delightful. Also not in my current pantry
              was pomegranate seeds. And I don't really care for them. Love the flavor but don't like the texture. I subbed in some dried cranberries that I poured boiling water over to bring them back to life. I
              used dried cilantro instead of fresh, but if you had any fresh herbs (dill, parsley, or basil), I think they would work perfectly. The walnuts and olive oil over the grilled eggplant and cheese are
              the real treat here. The textures blend together in that Middle Eastern combination that is less frequently found in our American palette.</p>
            <p>Next was the <a href="https://www.sainsburysmagazine.co.uk/recipes/mains/zaatar-lamb-chops-with-salted-yogurt-sweet-herbs-and-pomegranate-molasses">Za'atar Lamb Chops.</a> Za'atar is a Middle Eastern spice blend. There just happened to be some in the pantry that Husband brought back from a trip abroad. But now that I'm out, I'll be
              making my own blend from <a href="https://www.feastingathome.com/zaatar-spice-recipe/">this website</a>. As we saw with the Garam Masala mix, these spices aren't as difficult to mix up as we
              might have thought. <br><br>
              I should step back and tell you that I started drining these Vodka Palomas before I started cooking last night. They are delicious. I love fresh grapefruit. Vodka instead of tequila will keep me out of
              trouble for the evening. A great drink-vodka (or tequila if you prefer) fresh grapefruit juice, a little lime juice, club soda, and a little salt (on the rim or toss it in on top). But a couple steps may have been missed
              in the recipe processes. I forgot to toast the walnuts. They were still great. And the Palomas were worth it. I also forgot to salt the yogurt beforehand.
              I just used Greek yogurt. This dish was still amazing. I used a raspberry-balsamic syrup I happen to have instead of pomegranate molasses. See, you can make a Turkish-inspired, lovely dinner with what is in your pantry. You just have to imagine a few substitutes along the way.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Did I forget to mention these Honey Yeast Rolls? I found this recipe yesterday while cleaning out a cabinet. I'm not sure where it came from but will credit the author when I figure it out.
                <blockquote><span class="recipeTitle">Honey Yeast Rolls</span>

                              1/4 cup honey<br>
                              3 Tbsp canola or olive oil<br>
                              1 1/4 tsp salt<br>
                              1 egg, lightly beaten<br>
                              2 1/4 tsp (one packet) yeast<br>
                              <br>

                              Place all ingredients in bread maker on dough setting. Turn out on lightly floured surface.
                              Knead 30 seconds, rest 10 minutes, covered. Punch down dough. Divide into 12-18 portions. Shape
                              into balls. Place on greased sheetpans. Cover, let rise 20 minutes. Bake 13 minutes at 400&degF.
                              Brush tops with butter.
                            </blockquote><br>
              <p>These were very easy in the bread maker and then a quick rise as rolls before popping into the oven. The house smelled great last night. Fresh rolls and lamb.<br>
              Hoping to get some Moussaka going this week. Feeling like a sweet snack right now. Will go find something tasty to whip up. Details on it next time. Have a great day!</p>

            <p>Happy Earth Day! With so many of us staying at home recently, the earth is looking better. I've noticed the stars here in town are brighter. Smog has dissapated all over the world. It'a  nice gift
              to the earth this year, us giving it a break for a few weeks. So enjoy the clean(er) air today. Take a walk outside with your mask if you're able. I'm enjoying the flowers around the house, a rarity in our shaded lot.</p>

                These were really fast and tasty! They got a little messy but having sprayed the muffin pan with oil first prevented any sticking. I did have to find a translation
                <a href="https://www.food.com/recipe/bisquick-substitute-small-portion-381055">here of Bisquick</a> since I don't keep that on hand. I just realized in linking the recipe that I missed the shortning. That makes more sense now!
                I thought my dough was a little stiff. But they are still good. And who would have thought there was shortening in Bisquick??<br> The brown sugar and butter are melted
                in the muffin tins before adding the pecans and then the dough. This makes a crunchy, carmel-y topping on an otherwise not-overly-sweet muffin. It's a great combination
                for those not-too-sweet-tooths.</p>
