      <img src="#" alt="Picture of Karen">
      <p>Hello! My name is Karen. I have loved cooking and baking all my life. For the last 15 years I have run my family's buisness six days a week.
      With a busy social life and a rowing obsession as well, I haven't had much time for cooking lately. But with the whole world shut down due to
      the virus, I am rekindling an old passion.</p>

          <h2>New World, New Me</h2>
          <h6>April 4, 2020</h6>
          <p>Mama started teaching me to bake when I was 2 years old. With the family business very new, there was little money for end of year gifts
          to clients. Mama would start baking and freezing in September. I learned along the way. As a teenager, I started working in restaurant kitchens.
          I worked 10 years in the industry, cooking and waiting tables. After college, I made my way back to the family business. For the last 15 years, I
          worked six days a week. Which isn't bad. My folks worked seven days a week for decades. <br>Never having been one to give up my social life, the
          thing I ended up giving up was cooking. Between work, a rowing obsession, a stricter diet, and lots of workouts, something had to give. There are
          only so many hours in the day, unfortunately.</p>
          <p>But now there is the Covid19 Pandemic. The world has come to an abrupt halt. My world has come to an abrupt halt. My social life is now on
          FaceTime. The river, my rowing friends, and my boat are miles away. My CrossFit workouts are now on Zoom. And my job has all but ended. <br>So
          we can sit around and be sad, or try to make the best of things. Husband and I have a huge list of items to do around the house. And I am returning
          to my love of cooking and baking. I may have to work out some more to keep up with the calories, but there's time for that too!</p>
          <h3>Weekends Are For Cooking</h3>
          <p>I realized a couple weeks ago that everything on our paper kitchen calendar was just crossed out plans of a former life. So I have decided to
          put new things on the calendar. There's a family Zoom Happy Hour at 5p on Fridays. Check! Indian Food Extravaganza on Saturday. Check!<br>I am trying
          to find a routine in this new reality. It's not easy. So I'm devoting most of the weekends to cooking the more complicated dishes that may take more time.
          And I'm filling my calendar with delicious plans!</p>

              <p>I have always loved cookbooks. The descriptions, pictures, and instructions that become such a delicious thing for me to consume. A great cookbook
              will allow you to taste the food in your mind. And an awesome cookbook gives detailed instructions, follows standard recipe writing format, and calls
              for basic ingredients. (There is nothing worse than a cookbook that calls for a storebought box ingredient instead of its base parts.) <br>But the very
              best cookbooks explain so much more about what to do in the kitchen.</p>

              <p>I remember this book from when I was a kid. This wasn't the book I was allowed to touch. There was a more modern version that had most of the same
              recipies. But this one. This is the gold standard. Mama didn't let me <em>borrow</em> this book until I was in my thirites. And even then it was under
               threat of mama retaliation. But finally, a few years ago, she gave me this one and my Grandmother's 1963 Good Housekeeping Cookbook. These are two of
              my most prized possessions.</p>

              <h4>Nostalgia</h4>
              <p>Food is comforting. Our mothers and grandmothers (and fathers as well to be sure) nurtured us with food as we grew up. We associate certain foods
              with holidays, birthdays, sicknees, celebrations, and many more factions of our lives. So in this weird time in our world when everything seems uncertain,
              I want to comfort myself, my husband, and my neighbors with the foods from my childhood.</p>

              <p>The first thing I decided to make from the book was Mexican Wedding Cakes. The book gives this as their alternative name. The original name is
              Russian Teacakes. I like both names. They are a simple shortbread that is rolled in powdered sugar while still warm. I cut the recipe in half for
              this making. I'm trying not to gain too much weight while walking down this memory lane.</p>

          <h2>Stir Crazy</h2>

              <img src="resources/photos/torteWithWhip2.HEIC" class="leftPic" alt="Photo of my Lemon Schaum Torte" width="300">
              <p>This is my first full week at home. Last week I still had to work a couple days. And I went out for beer and vodka last Thursday before the full
                State of Georgia shutdown went into effect on Friday. My sleep schedule has rotated about 4 hours. For several years now I've been getting up at 5am
                to get to the river or CrossFit for early workouts. I'm working out just as much, if not more, now but since it's all at the house, there is no need
                to get up so damn early. And I need to work out this much to offset all of these tasty treats!
                After the wedding cookies, I dove right into the Betty Crocker cookbook. I bought a 30 pack of eggs to prepare for the quarantine. And then we got
                new chickens.</p>

            <div>
              <img src="resources/photos/chickens.HEIC" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="My five beautiful hens">
              <p>We have 5 beautiful girls who are laying everyday. We are awash in eggs suddenly. So I went big. Betty's <em>Lemon Schaum Torte</em>. Meringue shell,
                lemon pudding filling, fresh whipped cream. What's not to love here. I happened to have all of the things needed. And though in reality it only used
                three eggs, it felt like a lot. I cannot recommend this one enough. It was not difficult to make though it did take a lot of time. (There was time in
                an off oven and an overnight chill that I did not anticipate.) Check out the recipe <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/lemon-schaum-torte/d597710f-7441-4a12-bd27-352eaf768151">here.</a></p>

              <h3>What a Hootnanny!</h3>
              <p>I've also been spending some time in one of my favorite subreddits <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/">Old Recipes.</a>I found this great post
              for Nana's Hootenanny. <img src="resources/photos/nanasHootenannyCard.JPG" class="leftPic" alt="Recipe card for Nana's Hootenanny" width="300">I can no longer find the post. I'm so happy
              I saved this picture. u/harrypottertoots, if you're out there, thank you so much for this recipe. Please let me link to the post. There was a fun discussion
               in the comments about what exactly is a "square of butter." The concensus was two tablespoons. Which carved out of a stick is about a cube. This is a souffl&eacute;.
              Apparently it has a lot of names. Dutch baby. German pancake. Bismarck. And my absolute favorite Pfannkuchen. <br> But it's a souffl&eacute;. This is
              something I have avoided most of my cooking life believing it would be terribly difficut. <em>It is not.</em> I actually can't believe how easty it was.
              Just like the card says. Mix everything together. Put the square of butter in a pan in the oven. When it melts, pour the batter in. Watch delightfully from
              outside the oven window as it rises to the point of almost touching the top of the oven! <img src="resources/photos/ovenHootenanny.jpg" class="rightPic" alt="Hootenanny in the Oven" width="300"> As the commenters pointed
              out, this can be sweet or savory since the batter is neutral. I filled ours with mushrooms and onions saute&eacute;d with cured ham and topped that with <a href="https://www.savoryexperiments.com/baked-kale-gratin/">
              this kale gratin recipe.</a>I just used cheddar but, man, it was delicious!</p>

            <div>
              <h3>Naan Better</h3>
              <p>While I was busily prepping our hootenanny, someone lamented on our family WhatsApp that their favorite Indian restaurant had closed. I had takeout from that
              place last time I visited there. It was amazing. Sad they are not making it through this chaos. But this gave me the idea of putting things on the calendar.

          <h2>What Day Is It?</h2>
          <h6>April 9, 2020</h6>
          <div class="flex">
            <p>The days are blending together. Get up. Workout. Paint something. Workout. Cook something. Drink heavily. (Oh, I should apply this resurgence of cooking love
              to my drinking as well.) I just heard a friend talking about a <em><a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-a-shrub-759919">shrub</a></em> and I think
              I will try that out tonight.<br>The only things on my calendar are video happy hours with friends and family. This is how I know what day it is. Tonight I
              get to see my rowing group. I miss these ladies so much. We have spent years of early mornings on the river together. It is a peaceful way to begin the
              workday and I miss it dearly. Excited to actually get to see them all together tonight.</p>
              <div>
            <h3>Taco Tuesday</h3>
            <p>The week leading up to Indian Food Party had other ethnic dinners. I love Mexican food. I go into withdrawls if I don't get a taco every few days.
            So I decided to try making my own flour tortillas. To be honest, I much prefer corn tortillas but they are much more complicated. Flour tortillas were pretty
             straightforward. And they were good practice for Saturday's naan.</p>
            <img src="resources/photos/tortilla.HEIC" class="leftPic" width="300" alt="My first tortilla">
            <p>I used <a href="https://www.mexicanplease.com/flour-tortillas-made-bacon-fat/">this recipe</a> from mexicanplease.com that uses bacon fat instead of oil. Because
             pandemic, people. Gotta be frugal these days. There's a jar of bacon fat in my fridge at all times. I just found the best use for it! These tortillas were fantastic!
            And while they smelled like bacon (bonus!) there wasn't a bacon-y-ness added to the taste. My tacos still tasted like tacos. We used this heat-and-eat storebought
            carnitas I love from Kroger. 10 minutes to tacos. Perfect for busy weeknights. Or when you're feeling lazy during quarantine. I made a quick cabbage slaw with vinegar
            and my homemade hot honey for a little kick. Husband loved it.</p>

            <div>
            <h3>Naan More Waiting</h3>
            <p>Friday night I made a cooking plan for Saturday. There are so many parts of Indian cooking that I am not familiar with I figured I needed a game plan. Step one:
              My restaurant needed a name. Naan Better. You can find your own Indian restaurant name <a href="https://best4businesses.com/creative-indian-restaurant-names/">here.</a>
              After that an order of operations. Thaw chicken. (I am known to forget to thaw things.) Make the Indian spice mix Garam Masala. This was an easy mix. I have a serious spice obsession, so I
              didn't have to scramble for anything. <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/142967/easy-garam-masala/">Recipe here.</a><br>
              Next, make the <a href="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/samosa-recipe/">samosa filing.</a>This recipe is great. It's a bit of work but worth it. Good, easy-to-follow
              instructions for the filling and the dough. <img src="resources/photos/samosas.HEIC" class="leftPic" width="300" alt="Full plate of samosas">Made the dough next. I also added a <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/raita-indian-yogurt-cucumber-condiment">raita</a>
               sauce to go with the samosas. I couldn't get any cilantro to make the green sauce you get in takeout. But this creamy cucumber sauce was awesome.
              <p>While samosa dough was resting, made the naan dough. <a href="https://canadiancookingadventures.com/recipe/garlic-naan-bread-recipe/">
              This</a> is the recipe I used. Funny that the one I picked was from Canada, but it worked. well. I did let the yeast bloom a little too long and lost some fluffiness
              on the frying. But live and learn.</p>
              <p>After the naan and samosas were done, I finally made the <a href="https://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/recipes/gordon-ramsay-s-butter-chicken">Butter Chicken</a> using this Gordon
              Ramsey recipe. This was much easier than I thought it would be. And so delicious. Husband was super happy with dinner. Said it tasted like takeout. Karen for the win!</p>
            <img src="resources/photos/naanBetterPlate.HEIC" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="My full plate of naan, samosas and butter chicken">
            <p>My Naan Better experiment kept me busy for about three hours. After an entire day of painting our porch, I was a nice change. I'm still not done painting the porch. Ugh.
            Husband asked for dessert last night. I was sad to respond that we had nothing left. Groceries are being delivered today though. And he asked for another lemon torte.
            I started that this morning. My second try looks much better. Pictures tomorrow. Have a great evening!</p>

          <h2>TGIF, Good Friday!</h2>
          <h6>April 10th, 2020</h6>
          <div class="flex">
            <p>I'm not a religeous person, but I love a holiday. Grandma said you had to wait until Good Friday to plant in the garden or take the potted plants outside. Here in the South,
            Easter is notice that it is really Spring. This is a fairly late Easter so Spring has sprung for the most part. It is a little chilly today. But I've been running in shorts and
            tanks for over a week. No complaints.<br>
            Friday is Friday. Even in quarantine. I stayed in bed a little longer this morning. Gave myself the day off from the house list. And got busy before my noon workout.
            Discovered Betty's Refigerator Cookies. <img src="resources/photos/fridgeCookies.HEIC" class="leftPic" width="300" alt="Refridgerator Cookies Sliced on Board"> Butterscotch and Vanilla.
            Although there are several variations for these cookies. These will be great for the nights when Husband asks, "Do we have any cookies?" This way we don't have to have cookies.
            They are easily made. And fresh cookies are the best anyway. The dough can also be frozen.<br>I cut the recipe in half and made the two different flavors. Threw them in the fridge until just a minute ago.
            Now I have cookies! Betty's website seems to have altered the original recipe somewhat. <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/brown-sugar-refrigerator-cookies/96eed629-c5ae-4752-992b-c7e8010cd5e7">This recipe</a> is a bit
            of a mix of two of the variatios in the book. The vanilla version used only granulated sugar while the brown sugar version was called butterscotch. Both of these flavors omitted the
            cinnamon. Cinnamon had it's own variation. But play around with it. I'm sure they will all turn out wonderfully!</p>
          </div>
          <img src="resources/photos/fridgeCookiesPlated.HEIC" class="rightPic" width="300" alt="Cookies plated on top of cookbook">
          <div class="flex">
            <p>While the cookies were in the fridge, I did my noon workout on zoom. Really nice to see my coach. I go to a small gym. I miss everyone. I miss seeing people...<br>
            Anyway. I also did a little bit of work and made a batch of Almond Liqueur and started a batch of Coffee Liqueur. These are two of my go to Christmas gifts. And two of my favorite
            liqueurs. I made a special trip to the liquor store before the state shut down to make sure I had Smirnoff 100 proof to make these. Once you make your own, you'll never buy the
            name brand stuff again. These are so simple to mix up and you can adjust them to your own taste. The <a href="https://bellalimento.com/2012/12/29/how-to-make-amaretto/">almond liqueur</a>
             is ready to drink as soon as it's made. The <a href="https://lovelygreens.com/how-to-make-kahlua-homemade-coffee-liqueur/">coffee flavor</a> takes about
            a month (but you can start stealing a drink or two after a couple weeks!) You can also substitute brewed coffee for the hot water if you don't have instant coffee. This can also be made decaf.</p>
            <img src="resources/photos/meringueCircleToasted.HEIC" width="300" alt="Toasted meringue shell">
            <img src="resources/photos/circleTorteNoWhip.HEIC" width="300" alt="Meringue shell filled with Lemon pudding">
            <p>And yesterday's lemon tarte? Specatacular! It's prettier than the first. Still tastes wonderful. A couple more tries and I won't need the recipe. I do think I lost a little on the
              consistency of the meringue in scaling back the sugar. It wasn't enough of a difference in calories to be worth it. Next time I will put the whole amount of sugar in and just do a
              few more situps! Family zoom happy hour starts in 5 minutes. Cheers! Have a great evening. Wash your hands and stay inside!</p>

        <h2>Happy Easter!</h2>
        <h6>April 12, 2020</h6>
          <div class="flex">
            <p>It's been a quiet, rainy Sunday here in Atlanta. There's lots of family pictures from quarantined Easter celebrations all over. Glad to see some of the cousins still breaking out
            the fancy china and silver for the occasion. Things are a little more low key here. Haven't made any decisions about dinner yet. But! In honor of our friend Mr. Easter Bunny, I made
            <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/cake-doughnuts/ae6c2c05-13f6-4ae7-b978-4c82464be606">these</a>Rainbow Cake Donuts. These are not in the 1967 book but I've been dying
            to try them. And with Sunday's extra time, I actually broke out my Betty Crocker gel colors that have been hiding in the pantry.<br>I love cake donuts. I've never made them and thought they
            would have been much more difficult than they were. I used my 3" biscuit cutter and a bottle lid for cutting. They were fast to fry. And even the icing, while a little time consuming, was not
            difficult. Find the rainbow icing <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/rainbow-doughnut-icing/e5f74017-2f01-4b6d-8f4e-0da287395f98">here.</a></p>

            <p>I had considered dying a couple of eggs this morning. But decided a brightly colored, multiple icing involved donut recipe took place of dyed eggs. But I did make a few

            to shell. Happily though, deviled eggs leave any divots on the plate side hidden from sight.<br>A few tips from Mom: Flip the eggs over every 12 hours for a day or so before boiling. This will center the
            yolks. Put baking soda in the water while boiling. This can help loosen the shells. You can also slide a spoon beneath the shell to loosen it. And last, even if some of the whites aren't perfect,
            put them on the plate. It's better to show that you made the effort, even if the finished product isn't perfect.</p>
